# DataScienceProject

- The goal of the CSC 599.70 Course Project to apply our data handling and modeling skills taught in class to a real world data set.

- The sample Project could be found [here](https://github.com/grantmlong/itds-fall2019/tree/master/project).

## Requirements:

- (A team name)
- csv file with predictions against `test2.csv`. An example of the required formatting can be found [here](https://github.com/grantmlong/itds-fall2019/blob/master/project/sample_submission2.csv).
- A markdown file `initial_findings.md` containing:

    (i) A 200-300 word explanation of the expected performance of the model in terms of mean
    squared error and the key features driving the team’s modeling performance.

    (ii) A 200-300 word summary outlining the team’s intended strategy to improve the predictions
    for the final round.
